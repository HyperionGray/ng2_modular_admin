# Modular Admin for Angular2Dart

[View Demo](https://hyperion-gray.gitlab.io/ng2_modular_admin_demo/)

## Overview

This project is a port of [Modular
Admin](https://github.com/modularcode/modular-admin-html) to Angular2Dart.
Modular Admin is a Bootstrap 4 admin theme written with HTML, monolithic CSS,
and some JavaScript. This port focuses on converting monolithic CSS to web
components with encapsulated styles and reimplementing the JavaScript logic with
Angular 2 and Dart.

*This project is still alpha quality. Do not use it in your production
projects!*

## Building

Before building styles, you need `dart` and `sassc` installed, and you need to
run `pub get`.

To build styles, run `dart tool/build-styles.dart`.
